2
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:50,710
Yes.

3
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:53,543
Girl named Marry called
on the pay-phone.

4
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:57,165
Said she's set her parents
and you're invited to dinner.

5
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:01,122
Oh, yeah?

6
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:12,783
Thank you very much.

7
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,931
You're late, Henry.

8
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:32,591
I didn't know if you wanted me
to come or not. Where have you been?

9
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:41,341
You never come
around anymore.

10
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:57,405
Dinner's almost ready.

11
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:14,930
Come on in.

12
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,513
Hello there.

13
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:46,852
Hello.

14
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:51,858
I'm very pleased to meet you.

15
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,283
Sit down.

16
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,744
It's Henry. isn't it?

17
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:31,082
Yes.

18
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,867
Marry tells me you're a very
nice fellow. What do you do?

19
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:59,039
I-I am on vacation.

20
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:02,795
What did you do?

21
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:06,132
Oh, I'm sorry.

22
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:12,392
I work in the Lapell's factory.

23
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:16,982
I am a printer.

24
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:20,737
Henry is very clever in printing.

25
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:26,579
Yes, he sounds very clever.

26
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,514
I thought I heard a stranger.

27
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:43,979
We've got chicken tonight. Strangest
damn things, they're man-made.

28
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:46,608
Little damn things,
smaller than my fist.

29
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,111
But they're new.

30
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:51,198
I'm Bill.

31
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:58,708
- Hello, I'm Henry.
- Henry is at Lapell's factory.

32
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,212
Print is your business, ha?
Plumbing is mine.

33
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:06,010
30 years. I've seen has never had changed
for patching to the hell how it is now!

34
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:08,723
I put every damn pipe
in this neighborhood.

35
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:09,975
- Dad!
- Bill!

36
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:14,147
Pipes ain't growing alone. I make sure
they don't. Look at my knees.

37
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,738
- Look at my knees!
- Bill!

38
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:23,745
- Are you hungry?
- Bill!

39
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:42,695
The girls had heard this before...

40
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:47,286
but 14 years ago, I had
an operation on my arm here.

41
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,502
Doctors said I won't be able to use it.
But what the hell do they know, I said.

42
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:58,969
And I rubbed it for a half hour every day
and I've got those... I could move it a little.

43
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:05,019
And I got... so I could turn a faucet
and pretty soon I had my arm back again.

44
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:09,610
Now I can't feel a damn
thing in it. All numb...

45
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:18,580
I'm afraid to cut it, you know.

46
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:25,883
Mary usually does the carving but
maybe tonight you'll do it, Henry.

47
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:29,429
All right with you?

48
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,267
Of course.

49
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,523
I'd be happy to.

50
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:52,783
I just... just cut them up
like regular chickens?

51
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,286
Sure, just cut them up
like regular chickens.

52
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:53,674
It'll be all right.

53
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:57,427
Excuse me.

54
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:34,962
Well, Henry, what do you know?

55
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:44,554
I don't know much of anything.

56
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:25,426
Henry, may I speak
to you a minute?

57
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:27,928
Over here.

58
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,558
Did you and Mary
have sexual intercourse?

59
00:28:19,227 --> 00:28:22,980
- Why?
- Did you?

60
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:27,901
- Why are you asking me this question?
- I have a very good reason.

61
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:30,904
But now I want you to tell me.

62
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:37,786
I-I'm very... I love Mary.

63
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:43,374
Henry, I asked you if you
and Mary had sexual intercourse.

64
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:47,586
- I-I don't think it's any of your business.
- Henry!

65
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:51,757
Sorry.

66
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:57,596
You're in very bad trouble
if you won't cooperate.

67
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:06,354
Well... I...

68
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:13,027
- Mary!
- Mother!

69
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:18,449
- Answer me!
- I'm too nervous.

70
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:22,619
- There's a baby. It's at the hospital.
- Mom!

71
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:26,789
- And you're the father.
- It isn't possible...

72
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:31,586
- It's still unsure it is a baby.
- It's premature, but there's a baby.

73
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:36,799
After the two of you are married which should
be very soon, you can pick the baby up.

74
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:53,898
Mom, he's got
his nose bleeding.

75
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:00,988
I'll get ice.

76
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:11,623
Will you mind, Henry,
you and I getting married?

77
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,334
No!

78
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:28,931
This dinner is getting cold.

79
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:23,012
Is there any mail?

80
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:28,434
No.

81
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:41,739
Shut up!

82
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:48,621
Shut up!

83
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,354
I can't stand it.
I'm going home.

84
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,530
- What are you talking about?
- I can't even sleep. I'm loosing my mind.

85
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:14,743
You're on vacation, now.
You can take care of it for a night.

86
00:41:14,785 --> 00:41:17,871
Will you come back tomorrow?

87
00:41:17,913 --> 00:41:21,624
All I need is a decency of that sleep.

88
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:35,596
Why don't you just stay home?

89
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:38,932
I'll do what I wanna do.

90
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:43,937
And you better take real good
care of things while I'm gone.

91
00:45:09,963 --> 00:45:11,839
Oh, you are sick...

92
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:15,000
Move over.

93
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:55,037
Move over.
Move over!

94
00:58:04,646 --> 00:58:07,565
I locked myself
out of my apartment.

95
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:26,958
And it's so late.

96
00:59:27,015 --> 00:59:29,100
Where's your wife?

97
00:59:40,152 --> 00:59:44,114
She must've gone
back to her parents, again.

98
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:50,369
I'm not sure.

99
01:00:45,213 --> 01:00:48,132
Can I spend a night here?

100
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:16,395
In heaven everything is fine

101
01:03:17,021 --> 01:03:23,276
In heaven everything is fine

102
01:03:23,486 --> 01:03:25,571
In heaven everything is fine

103
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:39,125
You've got your good things
and I've got mine

104
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:49,551
In heaven everything is fine

105
01:03:50,177 --> 01:03:56,224
In heaven everything is fine

106
01:03:56,433 --> 01:04:03,314
In heaven everything is fine

107
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:09,778
You've got your good things
and you've got mine

108
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:29,171
In heaven...
...everything is fine

109
01:09:31,538 --> 01:09:34,457
Ok, Paul!

110
01:09:41,756 --> 01:09:44,883
Hi ya sonny,
what've you got there?

111
01:10:08,448 --> 01:10:10,946
Counter, Paul!

112
01:12:27,863 --> 01:12:30,361
It's ok.

114
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,121
