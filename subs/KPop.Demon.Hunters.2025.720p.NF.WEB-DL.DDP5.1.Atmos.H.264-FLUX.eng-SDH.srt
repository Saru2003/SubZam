The world will know you as pop stars,

Demons have always haunted our world,

13
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,822
stealing our souls and channeling strength
back to their king, Gwi-Ma.

14
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,826
Until heroes arose to defend us.

15

Born with voices
that could drive back the darkness.

16

Singing songs of courage and hope.

17
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,880
But Hunters are more than warriors.

18
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,262
Our music ignites the soul
and brings people together.

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,223
With this connection,

20
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:42,352
the first Hunters
created a shield to protect our world,

21

the Honmoon.

22
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,527
Every generation,

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,324
a new trio of Hunters
is chosen to fulfill our ultimate duty.

24
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,160
A barrier so strong it is impenetrable,

25
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,748
that will keep demons and Gwi-Ma
from our world forever,

26
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,917
the Golden Honmoon.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,837
And now, that duty falls to you.

28
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,423
- That victory is within your reach.
- [dramatic music continues]

[woman 1] Mira's my favorite.
She's the visual and lead dancer.

37
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,279
Nobody can move like Mira.

38
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,447
[woman 2]
She's the black sheep of her family.

Even though she's so cool.

40

Who else could wear a sleeping bag
to the Met Gala?

41

- [in unison] She's the best. Love her.

42

- We're here for Zoey!
- [woman 3] The rapper and lyricist.

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,334
[man 1] She grew up in America.

44
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,086
Somewhere called Burbank, USA.

45
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,921
[woman 4] She's the cutest maknae.

46
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,882
[man 1] But when she raps, she goes hard.

47
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,926
She gets real scary.
So scary, like, "You better watch out."

48
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,136
[girls] We love Rumi!

49
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,804
- She's pop-star royalty.
- Uh-huh!

50
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,849
[woman 5] Her mom, a Sunlight Sister,
died when she was a baby.

51
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,268
But Celine raised her,
and built Huntrix around her.

52
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,729
Rumi's voice is just incredible. Like…
